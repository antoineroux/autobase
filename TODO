* Cope with Liquibase's use of java.util.logging (UGH)
* Remove the println statements and turn them into logging statements
* Auto-launch an editor when a migration is created, assuming that $EDITOR is set.
* don't overwrite existing changelog.groovy file (or at least ask) when installing the plugin
* sort migration files according to file name and not according to relative path (i.e. author), 
  this enables multiple users to decide on the sequence their migrations will be run in using 
  a naming convention
